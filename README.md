The BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator is a simple command-line tool that calculates the Body Mass Index based on user-provided weight and height values. The Body Mass Index is a numerical value of a person's weight in relation to their height, often used to assess whether an individual is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.

This BMI Calculator is developed using HTML CSS & JS and is intended to be used as a basic utility for personal use or as a starting point for further development.
